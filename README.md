# Just Type...

Just Type... replacement feature for Android. Quick Type will allow you to search installed apps, search on Maps, YouTube, Wikipedia, send texts, start phone calls, and search the web. There is a widget that can be added to the home screen. Just Type... is launched by tapping on the widget.

This application is meant to go along with another one of my projects, W Launcher. But, I decided to open this up to all potential users, not just those using my launcher.
